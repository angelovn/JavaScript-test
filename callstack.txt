What is execution context???? !!!!!!!! REALLY
Execution context allow the JS engine to manage the complexity of interpreting and running my code
Whenever js file runs a global execution context gets created
it has 2 phases
1. creates the global object(depends on envouriment), this and allocates memory for all functions yet to be created and creates a scope chain()
2. execution phase. It reads the code line by line synchronous. When a function is getting invoked a new execution context gets created

Js has no data type definitions. Type becomes known at runtime
JS Engine
Engine contains heap(store all the objects in the application) and callStack(where the code is executed)

for function it also creates arguments object
